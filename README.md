# 105 C++ Algorithms 
#### Inspired by : [CppCon 2018: Jonathan Boccara “105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour”](https://youtu.be/2olsGf6JIkU?si=InJVY9EVt3usPcHM ) 

## Structure
All algorithms are placed in a separate folder numbered from 001 to 105. Each folder contains a separate source file with its own algorithm with some explanation.

## Build and Run 
Each folder contains its own main.cpp that can be compiled simply by executing g++ main.cpp creating an executable.
